# Twitter-sentiment-analysis

In this project, I have done some Natural Language Processing on the Twitter US Airline Sentiment Dataset, which contains data for over 14000 tweets. Then I have used several classifiers namely, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Decision Trees to predict the sentiment of the tweet i.e. positive, negative or neutral.
